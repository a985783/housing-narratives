Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, "The Friction Gate: Narrative Transmission in Housing Markets," for consideration as a Research Article in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization.

This paper addresses a fundamental puzzle in narrative economics: the transmission mechanism from public attention to aggregate economic activity. While narratives are increasingly recognized as drivers of economic cycles, empirical evidence on their predictive power remains mixed. We reconcile these conflicting findings by proposing and testing a "Friction Gate" theory.

Using a novel identification strategy that corrects for cross-market comparability in Google Trends data via pooled within-keyword z-standardization, we analyze a rigorously constructed panel of 127 U.S. Designated Market Areas (DMAs) from 2012–2024. Our results demonstrate that narrative attention is conditionally powerful: it significantly predicts transaction volume only in high-friction regimes—specifically when inventory is low and supply is structurally inelastic.

Our work makes three primary contributions:
1. Rigorous Identification: We establish a robust null baseline for the average effect of narrative attention, showing that previous findings of "universal" effects may be artifacts of measurement error.
2. The Friction Gate Theory: We provide evidence that market frictions are not merely impediments to efficiency but act as conductors that transmit narrative signals into the real economy.
3. Complex Systems Evidence: Our findings align with a complex adaptive systems (CAS) view, linking narrative economics with the physics of phase transitions and state-dependent feedback loops.

Given the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization's interest in the intersection of behavioral economics, complex systems, and institutional change, we believe our manuscript is a perfect fit for your readership. We show how the physical reality of scarcity validates and amplifies viral narratives, offering a grounded path forward for modeling expectations in constrained environments.

We certify that this work is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not currently under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission.

Thank you for your time and consideration of our work.

Sincerely,
